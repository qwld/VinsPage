METHOD: BOOST IGF-1

1. GH-IGF-1 Axis Stimulation (Synergize Both)
   - IGF-1 is liver-produced in response to GH. Maximize GH → Maximize IGF-1.
   - Use fasting, intense training, deep sleep, and GH boosters (see below).

2. Hyper-Focused Protein Intake
   - Eat 1.2–1.5g protein/lb bodyweight.
   - Prioritize: grass-fed beef, eggs, whole milk, colostrum, whey isolate, collagen.
   - Eat 4–6 meals/day — spread leucine-rich protein (3g+ leucine per meal).

3. Supplement Stack for IGF-1 Optimization
   - **Bovine Colostrum**: 20–40g/day (contains IGF-1 + growth factors).
   - **L-Glycine**: 3–5g pre-sleep — potentiates GH/IGF-1 response.
   - **Creatine Monohydrate**: 5g/day — supports muscle growth via IGF-1 signaling.
   - **Leucine**: 5g post-workout — key mTOR activator and IGF-1 supporter.
   - **Zinc + Magnesium**: optimize overall endocrine output.
   - **Vitamin D3**: 5,000 IU/day — supports GH → IGF-1 conversion.
   - **Copper** (if deficient): essential cofactor for IGF-1 function.

4. Exercise Protocol
   - Combine heavy resistance training (3–5x/week) with occasional sprints or HIIT.
   - Focus on eccentric overload and muscle time-under-tension.
   - Train fasted (GH spike), then eat a leucine/protein-rich post-workout meal (IGF-1 response).

5. Cold Exposure + Sleep Optimization
   - Ice baths 3x/week post-workout or in the morning → GH ↑ → IGF-1 ↑
   - Deep sleep (7.5–9 hrs): 70–80% of daily GH/IGF-1 is secreted during deep sleep.
   - GABA + Glycine + Magnesium stack pre-bed to maximize REM/deep sleep quality.

6. Increase Insulin Sensitivity (IGF-1 potentiation)
   - Improve insulin sensitivity: berberine, cinnamon, daily walking, strength training.
   - Avoid chronic carb restriction — IGF-1 requires insulin to be fully expressed.
   - Carbohydrate backloading post-training helps drive IGF-1 production.

7. Refeed Strategy + High-Caloric Phases
   - Occasional overfeeding (1–2 days/week) post-fasted training → hormonal supercompensation.
   - Emphasize carbs and protein together post-fast.

8. Liver Health Optimization
   - IGF-1 is made in the liver.
   - Use NAC (600–1,200mg/day), milk thistle, and avoid alcohol/toxins to support IGF-1 output.

9. Advanced Hacks (Legal)
   - **Red Light Therapy to Liver & Abdomen**: 850nm for 10–15 min, 4–5x/week.
   - **Sauna + Cold Plunge Combo**: enhances endocrine resilience and GH response.

10. Bloodwork Monitoring (Every 10–12 Weeks)
   - Track IGF-1, GH, insulin, SHBG, ALT/AST, and fasting glucose.
   - Adjust based on feedback: refeed more if IGF-1 is low despite fasting, or increase protein density.

BONUS(s) (Optional)
   - **Velvet Antler Extract** (legal in most countries): Contains IGF-1-like peptides.
   - **GPC/Glycerylphosphorylcholine (Alpha-GPC)**: 600mg pre-training to increase GH surge → IGF-1 rise.

WARNING: IGF-1 increases cell growth and regeneration but can also promote unwanted cell growth if abused. Use with awareness and always cycle aggressive strategies.

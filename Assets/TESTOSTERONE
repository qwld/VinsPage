METHOD: BOOST TESOSTERONE

1. High-Intensity Strength Training (4–5x/week)
   - Focus on big lifts: squats, deadlifts, barbell rows, overhead press.
   - Train in the 6–10 rep range, use progressive overload.
   - Short rest between sets (60–90 sec) to maximize T spike.

2. Strategic Fasting (24–36 Hours Occasionally)
   - Use once weekly: fasting can spike luteinizing hormone (LH), leading to elevated T.
   - Follow up with high-protein, high-fat refeed meals.

3. Advanced Supplement Stack
   - **Tongkat Ali (Eurycoma Longifolia)**: 400–600 mg/day (standardized to 2% eurycomanone).
   - **Fadogia Agrestis**: 300–600 mg/day (use only for cycles of 8–12 weeks).
   - **Boron**: 3–10 mg/day — reduces SHBG, increasing free testosterone.
   - **Zinc + Magnesium (ZMA)**: 30–50 mg zinc, 200–400 mg magnesium.
   - **DHEA**: 25–50 mg/day (if 35+ years old; blood test recommended).
   - **Vitamin D3**: 5,000 IU/day with K2-MK7.

4. Cholesterol-Heavy Diet (For Testosterone Substrate)
   - Eat whole eggs (3–6/day), grass-fed beef, liver, butter, olive oil, nuts.
   - Aim for at least 30–40% of total calories from fat (especially saturated and mono-unsaturated fats).

5. Sleep Like a Machine
   - 8–9 hours every night. No exceptions.
   - Use magnesium glycinate, ashwagandha, and blue-light blockers to enhance sleep quality.

6. Eliminate Estrogenic Exposure
   - No plastic bottles, BPA, soy, seed oils, or artificial scents.
   - Use glass, stainless steel, and organic hygiene products.
   - Filter water (fluoride & heavy metals lower testosterone).

7. Heat Exposure + Cold Exposure
   - **Saunas (3–5x/week)**: Boosts heat shock proteins and LH indirectly.
   - **Cold Showers / Ice Baths**: Post-workout and in the morning to spike norepinephrine/testosterone.

8. Sexual Activity + Alpha Behavior
   - Regular sexual activity raises testosterone baseline.
   - Confidence, aggression (controlled), goal pursuit, and status-seeking behavior correlate with higher T.

9. Herbal Potentiators (Cycle in Blocks)
   - **Ashwagandha**: 600 mg/day — reduces cortisol, boosts testosterone 10–20%.
   - **Mucuna Pruriens (L-Dopa)**: 300–500 mg — boosts dopamine & LH.

10. Bloodwork-Driven Optimization
   - Get labs every 8–12 weeks: Total T, Free T, SHBG, LH, FSH, E2.
   - Adjust supplement stack and sleep/nutrition based on trends.

BONUS: Red light therapy to testes (850nm wavelength, 10–20 minutes 3–5x/week) has early evidence for modest testosterone increases via mitochondrial stimulation.

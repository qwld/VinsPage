METHOD: Maximize Natural Human Growth Hormone (HGH) Levels

1. Sleep Optimization
   - Deep, uninterrupted sleep (7.5–9 hours) is the #1 trigger for HGH.
   - Sleep in complete darkness and cool temperature.
   - Go to bed by 10–11 PM to align with peak GH pulses.

2. Intermittent Fasting (IF)
   - 16:8 or 18:6 fasting windows can raise HGH by up to 1,300% in women and 2,000% in men.
   - During fasts, GH increases to preserve muscle and lean mass.

3. Intense Exercise (especially HIIT)
   - Sprints, resistance training, and compound lifts trigger significant GH release.
   - Keep rest short (30–60 sec) to boost lactic acid and GH response.

4. Cold Exposure
   - Ice baths or cold showers may stimulate GH via norepinephrine and stress adaptation.

5. L-arginine & L-ornithine
   - 5–9g of L-arginine before bed (fasted) may enhance nocturnal GH release.
   - Use under supervision, as high doses can cause GI discomfort.

6. Avoid Sugar at Night
   - Insulin suppresses GH. Avoid carbs 2–3 hours before bedtime.

7. GABA Supplementation
   - 3g GABA pre-sleep can increase GH via nervous system modulation.

8. Melatonin
   - 0.5–5mg before bed can enhance GH via circadian rhythm support.

NOTE: These are natural pathways with scientific backing but require consistency.
